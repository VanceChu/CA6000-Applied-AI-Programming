This repository stores course materials and practice code for **CA6000: Applied AI Programming**,
a core course in the **Master of Computing (Applied Artificial Intelligence)** programme at
Nanyang Technological University (NTU), College of Computing & Data Science (CCDS).

> This repo is mainly for my own study, review, and version control of course-related work.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized to separate course materials from my personal practice:

- **`Course Notes(PPT)/`** Lecture slides and PDF notes provided by the university (e.g., *Topic 1 – Python Basics*, *Topic 5 – NumPy*).

- **`Sample Codes/`** Official example code provided by the teaching team.

- **`Software Tools/`** Guides on development tools (Jupyter, Git, Environments).

- **`Practice_Notebooks/`** My personal Jupyter notebooks for in-class demonstrations and after-class exercises.  
  *(e.g., `Nov18.ipynb`, `Topic9_Pandas.ipynb`)*

- **`Datasets/`** Raw data files (CSV, JSON, TXT) used within the practice notebooks.

- **`assignments/`** *(Coming soon)* My assignment implementations and reports.

## How I use this repository

- **Keep everything in sync with GitHub**

  1. Edit notebooks and code locally (VS Code + Jupyter).  
  2. Save changes and run:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Update progress to slide XX"   # or another meaningful message
     git push
     ```

- **Track my learning progress**

  Commit messages like `Update progress to slide 25` indicate how far I have worked
  through the lecture slides / exercises inside the corresponding notebook.

- **Experiment freely**

  I sometimes create scratch cells / small experiments directly in the notebooks.
  Git history allows me to roll back to earlier versions if needed.

## Environment

The code in this repo is mainly written and tested with:

- **Python**: 3.x  
- **Core libraries**:  
  - `numpy`  
  - (More libraries may be added later as the course progresses.)

I usually work in:

- **VS Code** with the Python & Jupyter extensions  
- Conda environment dedicated to CA6000 (e.g. `ca6000`)
