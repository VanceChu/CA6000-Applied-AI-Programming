This repository stores course materials and practice code for **CA6000: Applied AI Programming**,
a core course in the **Master of Computing (Applied Artificial Intelligence)** programme at
Nanyang Technological University (NTU), College of Computing & Data Science (CCDS).

> This repo is mainly for my own study, review, and version control of course-related work.

## Repository structure

The folder structure may evolve during the trimester, but roughly:

- `Course Notes(PPT)/`  
  Lecture slides and PDF notes for each topic
  (e.g. *Topic 1 – Python Basics*, *Topic 5 – NumPy*, etc.).

- `Sample Codes/`  
  Example code provided by the teaching team.

- `Software Tools/`  
  Slides and notes about development tools used in the course
  (e.g. Jupyter, Git/GitHub, Python environments).

- `*.ipynb` at the root (e.g. `Nov18.ipynb`, `Topic5_NumPy_Practice.ipynb`)  
  My own Jupyter notebooks for in-class demos, after-class practice, and small experiments.

Over time I may add more folders such as:

- `assignments/` – my assignment implementations and reports (if allowed by course policy)  
- `projects/` – any course project code or experiments

## How I use this repository

- **Keep everything in sync with GitHub**

  1. Edit notebooks and code locally (VS Code + Jupyter).  
  2. Save changes and run:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Update progress to slide XX"   # or another meaningful message
     git push
     ```

- **Track my learning progress**

  Commit messages like `Update progress to slide 25` indicate how far I have worked
  through the lecture slides / exercises inside the corresponding notebook.

- **Experiment freely**

  I sometimes create scratch cells / small experiments directly in the notebooks.
  Git history allows me to roll back to earlier versions if needed.

## Environment

The code in this repo is mainly written and tested with:

- **Python**: 3.x  
- **Core libraries**:  
  - `numpy`  
  - (More libraries may be added later as the course progresses.)

I usually work in:

- **VS Code** with the Python & Jupyter extensions  
- Conda environment dedicated to CA6000 (e.g. `ca6000`)
